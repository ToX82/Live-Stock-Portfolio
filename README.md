# Live-Stock-Portfolio
A minimalistic stock portfolio

### Why
Because I needed an easy to use stock portfolio, with (sort of) real time updates. With Stop Loss and Take Profit notifications, history values etc.

### What languages does it support?
Only italian for now, sorry. I plan to add multilanguage support as soon as possible though, so keep an eye on it :)
